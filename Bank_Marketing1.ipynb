    "# Comparing Classifiers to Predict Best Marketing Campaigns for Banking \n",

    "**Overview**: The goal of this project is to compare the performance of several classifiers (K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines) on a dataset from a Portugese banking institution which is a collection of the results of multiple campaigns. .  We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.  \n",

    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on direct marketing campaigns (phone calls). This allows the bank to optimize resources by targeting likely subscribers, reducing campaign costs while maintaining or increasing success rates (from ~11% baseline). From CRISP-DM-BANK.pdf, the data covers 17 campaigns (2008-2010) with 41,188 contacts and an 11.3% success rate. Key challenge: Class imbalance and features like 'duration' (post-call knowledge, use for insights but exclude for realistic prediction)."

    "The dataset represents outcomes from **17 direct marketing campaigns** conducted by a Portuguese bank between May 2008 and November 2010, totaling 79,354 contacts (though the UCI version provided has 41,188 instances, likely a processed subset). These campaigns focused on promoting long-term deposit subscriptions via telephone (dominant channel, sometimes aided by online banking), amid economic pressures like the financial crisis, which drove the need for efficient targeting to reduce costs while boosting financial assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key insights on the data:\n",
    "- **Structure and Attributes**: Each instance (contact) includes client data such as age, job, marital status, education; campaign details such as contact type, month, duration; previous outcomes such as pdays, poutcome; and social/economic context such as employment variation rate, consumer confidence inde. The target 'y' is binary for success/failure of subscription, with only ~8% successes (6,499 total), highlighting severe class imbalance.\n",
    "- **Challenges and Considerations**: Analysis suggest 'duration' (call length) strongly correlates with success but is only known post-call, making it unsuitable for prospective predictions—use it for insights/analysis only. Missing values ('unknown') in categorical features can be treated as a category or imputed. The data emphasizes directed marketing's efficiency over mass campaigns, with DM techniques like DT, NB, SVM used to model patterns for better resource allocation.\n",
    "- **Business Context**: The goal is predictive modeling to identify high-potential clients, supporting CRISP-DM phases (e.g., data preparation, modeling with metrics like ROC/Lift). This enables actionable insights, such as prioritizing contacts based on economic indicators or past interactions, amid privacy concerns and low response rates (<1% for mass campaigns).\n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding informs our approach: Focus on handling imbalance (e.g., F1/AUC metrics), feature engineering (e.g., encode categoricals), and interpretability for business decisions.\n"

This acts as implicit missing values and should be handled through impute with mode for low-frequency cases or drop columns/rows for high-frequency. For numeric 'pdays', 999 is a sentinel value; recode to -1 or a binary flag to avoid bias. 'previous' and 'poutcome' relate, with 'nonexistent' valid for no prior campaign.

    "### 11: Improving the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the basic models (LR, DT, KNN, SVM) from prior steps, we'll address the three exploration areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More Feature Engineering and Exploration**: The dataset lacks a 'gender' feature (closest is 'marital', but no direct gender). If hypothetical, we'd drop gender if no correlation with y (e.g., chi-square p>0.05) to avoid bias/irrelevance; here, add 'age_bin' (binned age for non-linearity) and 'contacted_before' (binary from pdays for prior engagement). Explore via importances/correlations—keep if >0.1 correlation with y, drop low-impact like 'day_of_week'.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Grid Search**: Use GridSearchCV (cv=5, scoring='f1' for imbalance) to optimize: LR (C for regularization), DT (max_depth/min_samples_split to reduce overfit), KNN (n_neighbors for balance), SVM (C/kernel for boundaries). This boosts F1 ~0.1-0.3 vs defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjust Performance Metric**: Accuracy (~89%) is misleading due to imbalance (88% 'no'); switch to F1-score (balances precision/recall on 'yes') and AUC-ROC (threshold-invariant, better for probability outputs). Aim F1>0.4, AUC>0.75 post-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These yield better generalization; DT often improves most with tuning for interpretability.\n"
